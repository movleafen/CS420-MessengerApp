# Multiple Chat Room via iO-Socket
I created this project from learning node.js, express.js and io.socket.

To run this project, just npm start // in the main folder, assuming that you have NODE.JS installed on your PC// 

I created this project because I want to challenge myself.

This chat rooms have a lot of things that need improvement.
Future goals to implement:
   d̶d̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶r̶n̶a̶m̶e̶
    Chat history,
    Better visual looking,
    A little chess game,

More goals will added once these tasks above are finished
